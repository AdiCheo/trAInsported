To do for trAInsported:
=========================

**Map (Editor)**
- Tile map
- Random environment pieces

**Sandbox**
- Events:
	-[x] "Init"
	-[x] "chooseDirection"
	-[x] "New Passenger"	-- special argument if the passenger's a VIP.
	-[x] "Arrived at Passenger's tile"
	-[x] "Arrived at Passenger's destination"
- Functions:
	-[x] "drop off passenger"		-- removes passenger from train
	-[x] "pick up passenger"
	-[x] "Random"
	-[x] "Print"

**Server**

**Security**
- Before download/upload, add a line that won't allow the scripts to be run without the game.
- Automatically replace windows line endings with unix line breaks.

**Game**
- Add VIPs
- Add Hotspots
- Randomize order in which players get to move
- Beautify rails	(shadows?), increase # of waypoints
- buy new trains
- rework train movement: make it pixel-independet and make it work with percentages.

**Visual**
- clouds, trees, water
- rework all visuals

**Misc**
- Add tipps
- No guarantee that game's outcome is always the same...
